# Chucnk-Norris-Joke

### [**Live App**](https://random-chunck-norris-joke-peta.netlify.app/)

## Description

This random-chuck-jokes application is built with Typescript and React context. It is collected from the Frontend Recruitment Task project designed with [zeplin project](​https://app.zeplin.io/projects) and resourced API [icndb.com API](http://www.icndb.com/api/).

## Folder descriptions

Random-joke is the root folder that has several components in it.

- GlobalApp folder handles all the global code like context, display as home page and global style to handle the default styling.
- The StyleComponent folder is occupied with only styles components.
- Interfaces folder keeps the types that is used in the app
- The Reducer folder handles the reducer functionality.

## Experience

In this project, I faced quite a lot of struggles to get most of the features.
Building an app with Typescript is still challenging for me so I got confused on accessing multiple functions from the globalContext file.
I was struggling to get the select and the input to work fine.

## What I Have Learned and Improve

I learned new things by creating a chuck-norris-joke application like knowing the importance of using the strim(‘’) and . It was amazing!

Having good name variables and functions are keys to understand more about code. It should always relate to what your functions do and help you to code it and find easily what I should code now. Not only for yourself to understand but also for others.
